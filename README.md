# Forest Fire Smoke Detection 🔥🌲

Automatically detect forest fires and smoke using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## 📌 Project Description

**Forest fires** are one of the most devastating environmental disasters, causing severe damage to ecosystems, air pollution, and endangering human lives. This project leverages **Computer Vision** to classify forest imagery into three categories: **fire**, **smoke**, and **neutral** (no fire/smoke).

The model is designed to support early warning systems through automated visual detection.

## 🗂️ Dataset

Dataset used:
[Forest Fire, Smoke, and Non-Fire Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amerzishminha/forest-fire-smoke-and-non-fire-image-dataset)

The dataset is organized into three folders: `Train`, `Validation`, and `Test`.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify images into `Fire`, `Smoke`, or `Neutral`.
- Build a CNN-based model to detect fire-related phenomena from images.
- Support AI-based disaster mitigation systems.

## 👥 Target Users

- Local governments
- Fire departments

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 Model Overview

- The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation are applied.
- Evaluation includes accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and prediction visualization.
