    **Fire Image**: Defined by the dominant colors of bright red and orange, often accompanied by forms of burning flames or spreading flames. The characteristic of this class is the high intensity of light and a clearly visible burning pattern defining the presence of an active fire.

    **Smoke Image**: Defined by a whitish gray color that covers the image area. Its shape obscures the objects behind it. The uniqueness of this class lies in its opaque texture and transparent gradation, which indicates the presence of fire smoke.

    **Non-fire Image**: Defined as an image without any indication of fire or smoke, usually showing a calm forest scene with a blue sky. There are no flaming shapes or smoke haze. Its visual calmness clearly distinguishes it from the other two classes.

    The figure above shows the data distribution in the training set for three classes: fire, smoke, and non-fire.

    Each class has almost the same proportion, which is around 33.3%.

    This shows that the dataset is balanced, so the model does not need to be given special treatment such as oversampling or undersampling to overcome class imbalance (imbalanced data).
